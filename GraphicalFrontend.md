# Using the graphical interface of Ghost #

This is only a quick introduction into the graphical user interface. It's not a huge application, so I'll spare you lengthy explanations.

The app supports two modes of operation:
  * In manual mode, you can mount and remove a virtual device by clicking a button. This is particularly useful for testing and to format the emulated device initially. Results are recorded in the log window.
  * In automatic mode, the frontend will mount the emulated device periodically -- in the background, if you wish -- and record any results in the log window. You can use this feature to check your computer for infections with USB malware on a regular basis.

**Note:** The frontend always uses virtual device 9.
